* Robidhood had emerged as a major partner in the investment field and a prominent partner in the broker field as well.

* Robinhood competitors include webull, etrade, sofi, and emeritrade


* Robinhoods's biggest impact has been giving access to investment options for more people and for a lower price
## Results


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

* As of now I the only reccomendation would be for Robinhood to continue the expansion into field like crypto and alther alternative financial investment instruments.

* Robinhood should probanbly move more into a realm of being a third party for companies who want to invest and use it as a platform. I tihnk they could use the app to integrate themselves into mroe platforms like a way to be used as a payment service in the asme way as bitcoin or paypal.
